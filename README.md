# I'm Ayodele John Oluwaseyi

I'm a **Backend-Focused Full-Stack Developer** passionate about building scalable, secure, and API-driven systems that power real-world products.  
My expertise lies in designing backend architectures, integrating multi-provider APIs, and deploying cloud services — from authentication layers and cron jobs to payment systems and real-time communication workflows.

With a strong background in **cybersecurity** and a hands-on approach to cloud infrastructure, I aim to deliver backend solutions that are **reliable, fault-tolerant, and globally scalable.**
